&lt;p&gt;Manhattanhenge occurs roughly two weeks before and after the summer solstice. We wanted to create a project that revolved around this timing. All of the sounds begin together, then then become polyrhythmic, and all align together 44 days later at the timing of Manhattanhenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created for Jeff Crouse and Brett Renfer’s Spatial Media class at NYU’s ITP program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mic Jammer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was made while a resident at Eyebeam during 2014-2015. The Mic Jammer is an ultrasonic security system that gives people the confidence to know that their smart phone microphones are non-invasively muted. It blasts a ton of ultrasonic noise at a iPhone mems microphone that is above the range of human hearing but still within the sensitive range of the mic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video explanation I did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://fffff.at/f-a-t-gold-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;FAT GOLD&lt;/a&gt; (the last fffff.at show ever) held in San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/128921351&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the video I made to accompany the Eyebeam installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/120425709&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My description at the time:
We now know that there are machines, cameras and algorithms everywhere that are listening to us. The creepiness and ensuing privacy debacle of products such Hello Barbie and the Samsung Smart Tv, both of which have microphones constantly listening, have been the most frequently mentioned products as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about our smart phones, the personal tracker we carry everywhere? What about when you’re having a face-to-face conversation and you wish that the microphone would be turned off (but you still need to use your phone)? Or what about those apps that have access to your microphone? What are they doing with that data? Don’t you wish you could just ‘turn off’ different aspects of hardware, like your microphone or camera?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires a hardware, not a software solution because software is infinitely hackable but you can guarantee through hardware that software can’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device that we made is like taping over your webcam, but for audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a collaboration with Eric Rosenthal, with whom I have been collaborating since he was my professor at ITP, along with Andy Sigler, who has also helped make some PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Papers</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;occupied-wall-st-journal&quot;&gt;Occupied Wall St Journal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Occupied Wall Street Journal came out of Zuccotti/Liberty Square in the Fall of 2011. I went there in the midst of a bit of a personal crisis, a friend I was supposed to move out with decided to live with her boyfriend, then we got bedbugs, and so I was staying on a close friend’s couch in Sunset Park. I went to Zuccotti Park the end of the first week of the occupation and found a job with my friend Kevin and the information desk. That time was sometimes spent talking to strangers about what we were doing (everyone, of course, had a different idea of what we were doing), directing other occupiers to whichever meeting they were looking for, and guarding this bucked of donation money (no clue where any of that went). I still remember the generousity of strangers who came with clothes, food, blankets and sleeping bags. I’ll always remember one of the few times I slept there staring at the looming HSBC Bank Building and knowing that this had changed my life and had changed the country and proud of myself that I had gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupy may have gotten shut down but it created the connections for all of the activism that happened in NYC for the decade to follow. It introduced me to radicals that altered the course of my political education. I got involved with the Occupied Wall St. Journal sometime after they had published their second edution, if I recall correctly. I had written a small blog on Feministing criticizing the OWSJ masthead for being primarily men. (It was not, but two women were working under pseudonyms). They invited me to the Brecht Forum (rip) and allowed to stay, when, in the words of one of the editors they found out I was “a serious person.” There are many other controversies about this paper that is not my story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a communist editorial project was life changing. I had never had the experience of working on creating a message that both represented the masses but also didn’t speak for them. The OWSJ was printed five times locally, each with a distribution of 100,000 and once nationally – in San Francisco, Houston and Chicago. All editions were translated into Spanish, French, Greek and Arabic. Contributors included well-known writers such as Rebecca Solnit, Barbara Kingsolver, Cornel West, Chris Hedges and Matt Taibbi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the links for these projects are now dead, so I am going to do my best to archive them. There were many people that worked on all of these projects, some anonymously or pseudononymously, and the rest are listed on the masthead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Edition 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edition 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edition 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edition 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edition 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strike-the-prisons&quot;&gt;Strike the Prisons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year, some of the same group of people made a paper for what was at the time the largest prison strike in California’s history. The archived site was &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160325094446/http://striketheprisons.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;battle-of-new-york&quot;&gt;Battle of New York&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a paper in the 2016 primaries in support of Bernie Sanders and published a line that unfortunately came true: “a vote for Hillary Clinton could be a vote for Trump.” The archived site was &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160815061215/http://battleof.nyc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Log Jammer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//assets/img/log-jammer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;log jammer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plane flight used to disconnect us from technology, a walk in the woods and we were alone – yet the subways will soon have cell service and even Canada is putting wifi in all of its national parks. And so we’re at a place where everyone is constantly saying everything…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thesis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…but no one has anything to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who cares if we have endless information, if we’re constantly connected, if we can’t deal with it? How can anything change if we don’t talk to each other, work together? Because really, the problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing any miniscule gap of solitude in which they might eventually find something to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I made a log jammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The log jammer provides a safe space in the woods, a right to be alone. What a relief to have the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the rare, the thing that might be worth saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American phones operate on two different spectrums – GSM-850 and GSM-1900. This “cellphone jammer” creates noise at a specific radio wavelength so that cell transmissions can’t go through. I chose 1900 because that’s what my cell phone is on and doing both would be way too much work. Here’s a link to see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went through dozens of design iterations a pcb design software program called Eagle. You can see some of those iterations here and here. I also put it on Github.
logjammer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as urban infrastructure (a cell phone tower) is often disguised as a natural environment, I did the opposite – a jammer in a real log in real woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//assets/img/log-jammer2.png&quot; alt=&quot;log jammer&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;//assets/img/log-jammer3.png&quot; alt=&quot;log jammer&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;//assets/img/log-jammer4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;log jammer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Eric Rosenthal, scientist-in-residence at NYU-ITP, for his guidance and direction.&lt;/p&gt;

The Dumb Store is a demonstration of what can be done using dumb phones. It’s an exploration in resisting planned obsolescence and using current technology to its fullest capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dumb Store was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dumbstore/dumbstore&quot;&gt;open platform for anyone&lt;/a&gt; to submit their dumbphone-compatible &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170418022743/http://www.dumbsto.re/apps&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;. It was a collaboration between myself and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nas.sr/&quot;&gt;Ramsey Nasser&lt;/a&gt; in 2012-2013. We made the framework on Twilio and it went to the top of hacker news at the time. Twilio generously gave us some credits when a ton of people were using the service that we were paying for. Unfortunately I decided to buy a .re TLD which was expensive and I let it lag and now can’t buy it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prismbreakup.org/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; was organized by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, Aurelia Moser, Ramsey Nasser and myself in the summer of 2013, directly after Edward Snowden leaked information documenting widespread US surveillance and complictiy with Silicon Valley tech companies. The website was kindly made by Dan Pheiffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three day event brough together a wide range of technologists, artists and thinkers, many of who are more well-known today in the privacy/surveillance scene. It was held at the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eyebeam.org/&quot;&gt;Eyebeam&lt;/a&gt; location in Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/60928966&quot;&gt;DNA Spoofing: DIY Counter-Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video was made at ArtHackDay at 319 Scholes in 2013. It’s since been viewed 20k times on line and shown at more places than I can count, including every Holocaust Museum in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we anticipate the possibility of genetic surveillance in the post-apocalyptic present. As humans we are constantly shedding genetic material in public space. It is becoming increasingly common to use those traces for surveillance and reconstruction. As IP spoofing makes anonymous internet browsing possible, DNA spoofing extends that potential by scrambling genetic material, enabling anonymous physical trajectories in tandem with digital. In this spirit, our work offers some DIY techniques for counteracting genetic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started dumpster diving in Long Beach, CA in 2009 after realizing that the small, organic grocery store I frequented was very, very disorganized. After teaching SAT prep one winter night, I decided to check out the dumpster and found about eighty jars of peanut and almond butter. After that, I started taking a picture every night to document what I found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisisyourtrash.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;this blog &lt;/a&gt;because I wanted people to see how much food is thrown away. In fact, about 50% of all harvested food in America is eventually tossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia Scott of Wallet Pop came along once and interviewed me. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bargainbabe.com/2010/03/16/bargain-babe-goes-dumpster-diving/&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; was on the front page of AOL.com which resulted in a lot of internet discussion about trash. Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;amp;tbo=d&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;q=%22allison+burtch%22+dumpster+diving&amp;amp;oq=%22allison+burtch%22+dumpster+diving&amp;amp;gs_l=hp.3...10219.12662.4.12883.2.2.0.0.0.0.62.111.2.2.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.3.psy-ab.gcbq457jJ68&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.dmg&amp;amp;fp=ea7e351ab9da3dca&amp;amp;biw=1371&amp;amp;bih=710&quot;&gt;google it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bicycles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love riding bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008 I co-led a bike tour in Europe. Six teenage boys from Amsterdam to Paris. I laughed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009 I biked from New York City to Los Angeles as part of a tour for the Bicycle Film Festival and 42 Below Vodka, the sponsor of the festival. It was supposed to be a vodka marketing tour but really ended up being the best summer of my life and one of the reasons I moved to NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, I briefly worked for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rapha.cc/cycle-club/&quot;&gt;Rapha&lt;/a&gt; at their pop-up store on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery&quot;&gt;Bowery&lt;/a&gt; in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.good.is/posts/cat-6-competitive-commuting-turns-bike-rides-into-races/&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;GOOD Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, I labelled competitive bike commuting “Cat 6″ racing, a reference to competitive cycling in which one begins in Category 5 and progresses to Category 1. The New York Times referenced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/cat-6-and-competitive-commuting/&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;terminology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DD1630F931A25751C1A9669D8B63&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also &lt;a href=&quot;http://prollyisnotprobably.com/2010/11/good-competitive-commuting-turns-bike-rides-into-races/&quot;&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/11/things-are-looking-up-its-comfort-thing.html&quot;&gt;week&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/11/bsnyc-friday-kosher-wine-tasting.html&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;Bike Snob &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2011/05/probing-for-answers-cat-6-racing-boom.html&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordspy.com/words/competitivecommuting.asp&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://texlouisvillebike.blogspot.com/2010/11/cat-6.html&quot;&gt;countless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.normalguytri.com/journal/tag/news&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 I did an loop around the Adirondacks. Had some stupid bike problems, hitch-hiked to the next town (which had a Walmart but not a bike shop) and ended up finishing the tour with a race saddle and Look Keos on a shitty ass front-suspenion Walmart mountain bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012 I did a month-long solo tour from Boston to Prince Edward Island, took a train to Montreal and then biked back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Watching You</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;watching-you-a-love-story&quot;&gt;Watching You: A Love Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/56958834&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching You is an installation in three parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Viewers watched a video, entirely from surveillance cameras, about the artist as a cop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. At the ITP Winter Show, viewers were told that they were currently being surveilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. In exchange for me deleting one of their images from my computer, I would trade them an honest emotion – any sort of feeling, not necessarily about what they just watched, but just a personal emotion. I was surprised by the honesty I received. Many people didn’t care if I deleted their picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching You is documented &lt;a href=&quot;http://yrnotalone.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College Art Association, CAA Conference. &lt;a href=&quot;http://conference.collegeart.org/2013/artspace/medialounge&quot;&gt;TRANSMEDIATION&lt;/a&gt;. February 13-16, 2013. New York Hilton.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>About</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Allison Burtch is currently a strategist and researcher at Canopy, a Brooklyn-based startup creating a private recommendation architecture for the internet. Previously, she was the Speculative Hardware lead at UNICEF, creating the global strategy for drone delivery of vaccines and flood response. She taught “Critical Theory of Technology: Politics, Utopia and Code” at the School for Poetic Computation and was a resident at Eyebeam, the leading art and technology center in the United States, where she created a small ultrasonic hardware device that protects smart phone users from passive audio surveillance. She co-organized the Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference at New York University and PrismBreakUp in 2013. She has a master’s degree from New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently she was the Speculative Hardware lead at UNICEF’s Office of Innovation. She taught “Critical Theory of Technology: Politics, Utopia and Code” at the School for Poetic Computation. Her ITP masters thesis, the “log jammer” – a cell phone jammer creating a safe space in nature –was featured in Wired and many other publications. She’s collaborated on such projects as the Dumb Store – a mobile app store for dumbphones, co-organized Prism BreakUp at Eyebeam and the Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference at New York University. She was the lead researcher for Maya Lin’s online memorial “What is Missing?”. 
Previously, Allison was an editor of the Occupied Wall Street Journal, a six-edition print publication which was translated into six languages and distributed globally. She led a European biking and camping tour for teenagers, traveled by train from Kazakhstan to Beijing and lived on a boat. She has spoken internationally at conferences and universities. Allison Burtch has a master’s degree from New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a confident, unapologetic, honest and clear-eyed understanding of the way the world actually is and the context in which we all live. This comes from a deep history of studying the nuanced interplay of technology and politics, and how they inform each other to shape the world. I bring both contextual awareness and self-awareness into areas (tech, security, privacy) in which it has historically not existed, and successfully walk a fine and difficult line between critic and champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love applying this wealth of knowledge to help startups build something that might actually have an impact on the way people interact with technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interests: machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, explainability of AI, the data exchange model of the internet, privacy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey it’s Allison. I’m remaking this website after a long long time of it sitting on its wordpress shelf, happily getting hacked by some php bug. I then redirected through an archive.org site for a while but that’s not very elegant. Anyways! You don’t need to know any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a longer bio:&lt;/p&gt;
