I worked with SFPC for a couple years as both a teacher and on their steering committee. We thought it was really important that there was a theory component to the work at SFPC, that it wasn't just focused on making flashy tech projects. 

The syllabus for the course is reproduced [here on github](https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/syllabus.md)) and the project that my students made is [here](https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/zine.pdf).
