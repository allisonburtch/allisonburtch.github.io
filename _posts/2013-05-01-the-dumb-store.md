### The most inclusive mobile app platform. Ever.

The [dumbsto.re](https://web.archive.org/web/20170712083832/http://www.dumbsto.re/) was an inclusive app platform for obtaining information via dumb phones. The Dumb Store is a demonstration of what can be done using dumb phones. It's an exploration in resisting planned obsolescence and using current technology to its fullest capacity.

The Dumb Store was an [open platform for anyone](https://github.com/dumbstore/dumbstore) to submit their dumbphone-compatible [apps](https://web.archive.org/web/20170418022743/http://www.dumbsto.re/apps). It was a collaboration between myself and [Ramsey Nasser](https://nas.sr/) in 2012-2013. We made the framework on Twilio and it went to the top of hacker news at the time. Twilio generously gave us some credits when a ton of people were using the service that we were paying for. Unfortunately I decided to buy a .re TLD which was expensive and I let it lag and now can't buy it anymore.
