I used to have fantasies of being a writer. Being a writer is much different that writing. I learned that by working as a blogger. 

I recently wrote a couple pieces for Canopy: the first is about [how we think about strategy](https://canopy.cr/post/how-we-think-about-strategy-at-canopy). The second, longer piece talks about [machine learning, privacy and our interconnection](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy). 

Some stuff from a while ago:

I used to work as a [journalist][1] for [ANIMAL New York][2]. Some big pieces include [OWS][3], [lawsuits][4], [stop-and-frisk][5], Montreal [student protests][6] and [Jay-Z][7]. Have written elsewhere for the [Indypendent][8] and [Good Magazine][9].
