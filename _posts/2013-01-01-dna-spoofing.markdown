<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/60928966">DNA Spoofing: DIY Counter-Surveillance</a></p>

This video was made at ArtHackDay at 319 Scholes in 2013. It's since been viewed 20k times on line and shown at more places than I can count, including every Holocaust Museum in Europe. 

In this project, we anticipate the possibility of genetic surveillance in the post-apocalyptic present. As humans we are constantly shedding genetic material in public space. It is becoming increasingly common to use those traces for surveillance and reconstruction. As IP spoofing makes anonymous internet browsing possible, DNA spoofing extends that potential by scrambling genetic material, enabling anonymous physical trajectories in tandem with digital. In this spirit, our work offers some DIY techniques for counteracting genetic surveillance.

With [Heather Dewey-Hagborg][1], [Adam Harvey][2] and [Aurelia Moser][3].
