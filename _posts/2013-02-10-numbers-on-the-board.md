Manhattanhenge occurs roughly two weeks before and after the summer solstice. We wanted to create a project that revolved around this timing. All of the sounds begin together, then then become polyrhythmic, and all align together 44 days later at the timing of Manhattanhenge.

Created for Jeff Crouse and Brett Renfer's Spatial Media class at NYU's ITP program.
