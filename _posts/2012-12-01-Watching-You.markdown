### Watching You: A Love Story

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/56958834" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Watching You is an installation in three parts.

1. Viewers watched a video, entirely from surveillance cameras, about the artist as a cop.

2. At the ITP Winter Show, viewers were told that they were currently being surveilled.

3. In exchange for me deleting one of their images from my computer, I would trade them an honest emotion -- any sort of feeling, not necessarily about what they just watched, but just a personal emotion. I was surprised by the honesty I received. Many people didn’t care if I deleted their picture.

Watching You is documented [here][1].
