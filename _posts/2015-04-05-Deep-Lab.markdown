[Deep Lab](http://www.deeplab.net/) is a collective of cyberfeminist researchers, organized by STUDIO Fellow Addie Wagenknecht to examine how privacy, security, surveillance, and anonymity are problematized in the arts and society. The Deep Lab participants, all women, are an international group of new-media artists, visualization designers, data scientists, software engineers, hackers, journalists and theoreticians, who are engaged in the critical assessment of contemporary digital culture. In the second week of December, these experts will work at the STUDIO on an accelerated pressure project, and deliver four evenings of public presentations: the Deep Lab Lecture Series.
