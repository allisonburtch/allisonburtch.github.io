This [Firefox addon iterates](http://web.archive.org/web/20160603235836/http://www.allisonburtch.net/illuminator/) through all of the html text in your browser and whenever it finds a person or corporation from the data, it illuminates that relationship a little bit.

The main problem I was trying to solve was how to increase the spread of information about political and corporate relationships without making people go to one place for the data. So, I made an addon that appends brands, individuals and corporations with who they are owned by, other companies of which they are board members, or dates of acquisitions.

These ubiquitous relationships are often complex and unknown. It reveals the connections between corporations, brands and individuals by clarifying the corporate and political power structures of the 1%.

It appends that person, brand or corporation with who they are owned by, sponsored by, or acquired by. Data was compiled mainly from the [Little Sis API](http://littlesis.org/home/dashboard), lists of lists on Wikipedia, and other corporate watchdog sources.

N.B., the data was updated as of May, 2014. As there are infinite data points and everything is constantly changing, I give no guarantee that the data is 100% accurate. There will be bugs.

You can check out the code on [github](https://github.com/allisonburtch/internet_Illuminator).
