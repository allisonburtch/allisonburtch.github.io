I started dumpster diving in Long Beach, CA in 2009 after realizing that the small, organic grocery store I frequented was very, very disorganized. After teaching SAT prep one winter night, I decided to check out the dumpster and found about eighty jars of peanut and almond butter. After that, I started taking a picture every night to document what I found.

I started [this blog][1] because I wanted people to see how much food is thrown away. In fact, about 50% of all harvested food in America is eventually tossed.

Julia Scott of Wallet Pop came along once and interviewed me. The [video][2] was on the front page of AOL.com which resulted in a lot of internet discussion about trash. Just [google it][3].
