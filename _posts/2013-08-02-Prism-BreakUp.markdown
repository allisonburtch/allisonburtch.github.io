This [conference](http://www.prismbreakup.org/) was organized by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, Aurelia Moser, Ramsey Nasser and myself in the summer of 2013, directly after Edward Snowden leaked information documenting widespread US surveillance and complictiy with Silicon Valley tech companies. The website was kindly made by Dan Pheiffer. 
 
The three day event brough together a wide range of technologists, artists and thinkers, many of who are more well-known today in the privacy/surveillance scene. It was held at the former [Eyebeam](https://www.eyebeam.org/) location in Chelsea.
