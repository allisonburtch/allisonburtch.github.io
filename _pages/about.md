I have a confident, unapologetic, honest and clear-eyed understanding of the way the world actually is and the context in which we all live. This comes from a deep history of studying the nuanced interplay of technology and politics, and how they inform each other to shape the world. I bring both contextual awareness and self-awareness into areas (tech, security, privacy) in which it has historically not existed, and successfully walk a fine and difficult line between critic and champion. 

I love applying this wealth of knowledge to help startups build something that might actually have an impact on the way people interact with technology. 

Interests: machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, explainability of AI, the data exchange model of the internet, privacy

Hey it's Allison. I'm remaking this website after a long long time of it sitting on its wordpress shelf, happily getting hacked by some php bug. I then redirected through an archive.org site for a while but that's not very elegant. Anyways! You don't need to know any of this.

Here is a longer bio:
