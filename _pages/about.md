### About Me 
I care deeply about change, whether it's personal, political, societal or spiritual. I love the beauty of the natural world and the beauty of humanity and think that there is no environment in which we are separate; we co-create eachother. I strive to have a confident, unapologetic, honest and clear-eyed understanding of the way the world is and the context in which we all live. This comes from a deep history of studying the nuanced interplay of technology and politics, and how they inform each other to shape the world. 

I love applying this wealth of knowledge to help startups build something that might actually have an impact on the way people interact with technology. Please feel free to [get in touch](/contact.html)

### About this site

This site is an archive of the work that I did from 2010-2016. My old site was on wordpress, and some sort of php vulnerability led to that site selling japanese electdronics. I couldn't fix it so had to start fresh. So I needed to remake it, but how? How do I talk about work that I did in the past? I am proud that I made these things at the time that I made them. And for some of the projects I have a different view of who I was at the time and what I was doing. Most of the posts remain as they were, but for some I have added my current perspective on them.
